Building a webstore from the ground up. 

My wife needs a web store to sell her artwork. This site should be comprised of options for sale of prints, directly from the artist. And additional items with art printed to it, provided by dropshipping. 

This site will be a showcase of her artwork so design is of the upmost importance.
